2. **Prayer Times**: "Prayer times for Sharjah today"
3. **Budget Planning**: "Calculate budget for Abu Dhabi, 7 days, luxury"
4. **Trip Planning**: "Plan my 5-day trip to Dubai"
5. **Cultural Information**: "What cultural tips should I know for UAE?"

### Programmatic Testing
```python
from smart_uae_agent import SmartUAEAgent

# Initialize agent
agent = SmartUAEAgent(llm_provider="openai")

# Test queries
response1 = agent.chat("What can I do in Dubai?")
response2 = agent.chat("What are the prayer times for Dubai?")
response3 = agent.chat("Calculate budget for Dubai, 3 days, standard")

print(response1)
```

User: "What about prayer times there?"
Assistant: [Knows "there" refers to Dubai from context]

User: "And the budget for 3 days, standard style?"
Assistant: [Remembers Dubai and calculates budget]
```

To clear memory:
```python
agent.clear_memory()
```
