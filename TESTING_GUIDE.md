### Method 4: Manual Python Testing

```python
# Load and test individual functions
import json
from final_test import search_uae_knowledge, get_prayer_times, calculate_trip_budget

# Test knowledge search
result = search_uae_knowledge("attractions in Dubai")
print("Dubai attractions:", result[0]['attractions'])

# Test prayer times
prayers = get_prayer_times("Abu Dhabi")
print("Prayer times:", prayers['prayer_times'])

# Test budget calculator
budget = calculate_trip_budget("Dubai", 5, "budget")
print(f"5-day budget trip: ${budget['trip_total']}")
